# TCP over UDP

TCP and UDP are both protocols,built on top of the Internet Protocol, used for sending bits of data known as packets.<br />
TCP, the most common protocol on the Internet, stands for Transmission Control Protocol. TCP guarantees in-order transmission of packets and makes sure the recipient recieves all the packets, in other words, TCP guarantees reliability, there is no lost or corrupted packets in TCP transmission.<br />
On the other hand, UDP is unreliable and fast. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, a datagram is the same as a data packet. UDP does not guarantees the Receipt of data by the reciever, this means that if a packet is lost, there is no way the reciever can claim it again, however, since all those reliability overheads are gone, it works considerably faster.<br />
This project's objective is to help implementing a TCP protocol based on UDP for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This code is provided for educational purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
